# AFL Fantasy Player Picker
### Introduction
The aim of this project is to build an AFL Fantasy player selection program.
### The Philosophy
One of the things I would like to test with this project is a philosophy for selecting players, namely buying points, not good players.
The assumption being that you should think of players as point making machines, in a purely statistical manner, and ignore what your intuition and common wisdom tell you about their value.
This is the idea that the Oakland A's used to break the win streak record for the BBL in America, which can be seen in the movie Moneyball.
Obviously Baseball is fundementally different to AFL, and they thought of it as buying runs not points.
If you were an AFL recruiter, thinking about what players to draft and pick up in the off season, there isn't a direct analogy to buying runs,
because AFL is more dynamic. Luckily, I am not a recuiter and so I am not faced with the daunting task of recruiting players.
I get to deal in the realm of simulating the real thing, by building a fantasy team.
### The Question
Taking the above philosophy as a staring point, the question becomes the following. **What is the most amount of points I can buy for 14 million?** 14 million is the default starting funds to buy players with. There is many ways in which you might begin to answer the question. Perhaps the simplest approach would be to assume each player will perform exactly as they did last year in the coming season. This is obviously an over simplification, but gives a good starting point. To test this theory, I will build a team from the 2021 results, and then test it on the 2022 season outcomes.
